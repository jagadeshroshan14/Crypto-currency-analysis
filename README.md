# Crypto-currency-analysis
The price fluctuations of Bitcoin under speculative environment is studied. It
has been seen that the market trend points out an existence of a speculative bubble. Over
the course of the period from 2014 to 2018, the trend in price movements of bitcoin has
proved to be strongly speculative. In that regard, investors might be curious about what
drivers might be instrumental in these speculative price changes. After reviewing of NPV, it
was seen that NPV is not applicable to the case of cryptocurrencies due to their nature and
lack of free cash flows to base the asset valuation to some fundamental facts. Later, LPPL
model is reviewed, however, that also proved to be insufficient since it does not reflect the
investor speculations and inform much about price dynamics regarding behavioral finance
principles. Then, some papers from the past price fluctuations of bitcoin (for the period from
2010 to 2013) was reviewed and three key variables were determined which might explain
price movements. Public interest towards Bitcoin as interest-driven, regulatory and political
news about cryptocurrencies as event-driven and VIX as overall investor approach to Bitcoin
market have been taken. After running regressions, the only significant variable happened to
be public interest and popularity of Bitcoin. Although, for some cases, VIX variable also
explain price fluctuations for some intervals, in none of the cases event-driven variable has
long- terms effect on price fluctuations under speculative environment. Lastly, a robustness
test is also handled considering the “weekend effect” and it has been seen public interest
variable again proved to be a significant price determinant
